In 2022, Vrinda Fashion saw steady sales growth with notable peaks in May and December, suggesting strong performance during summer and festive seasons. Early months like January and February recorded the lowest sales, pointing to an opportunity for targeted promotions during these periods.
geographically, Uttar Pradesh emerged as the top-performing state, followed closely by Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Telangana. These four states together contributed a significant share of total revenue, making them strategic markets for expansion and increased marketing investment.
customer demographics revealed that women accounted for the majority of purchases, far outpacing men in total sales volume. The primary buying age group was between 30 and 49 years, followed by the 20–29 segment, indicating that Vrinda Fashion’s products resonate most with working-age adults who have higher spending power.
sales channels were dominated by Amazon and Flipkart, which together drove the bulk of online sales, while Myntra, Meesho, and other platforms played a smaller but still relevant role. This suggests that strengthening partnerships and advertising on these leading platforms could further enhance revenue.
In terms of order fulfillment, the majority of orders were successfully delivered, with a small percentage canceled or returned. While this reflects an efficient delivery system, reducing cancellations and returns could further improve profitability.
Overall, Vrinda Fashion’s 2022 performance highlights strong seasonal peaks, a loyal and clear target demographic, and reliance on a few high-performing states and platforms. With strategic promotions during slow months, deeper engagement in top markets, and optimization of product quality to reduce returns, the brand is well-positioned for growth in 2023.
